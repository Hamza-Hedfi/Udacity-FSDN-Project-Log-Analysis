# Udacity FSND Log Analysis Project
Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Log Analysis project.
# Description
This is my solution for the log analysis project, from the Udacity FSND.
## Program description
The reporting tool contains 3 functions, each answering one of the questions :
- What are the most popular three articles of all time?
- Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
- On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

The **output** file contains output from the program, so you can check its output.
## Database
The program uses the `news` database provided as part to the project with the VM from Udacity.
## How to run 
```
$ python log_analysis.py
```
#### Prerequisites
